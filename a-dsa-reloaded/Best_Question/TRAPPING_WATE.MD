Both solutions aim to solve the **trapping rain water** problem, but they use different approaches to calculate the amount of trapped water.

### Solution 1: **Two-pointer approach**
```java
public int trap(int[] height) { 
    int n = height.length; 
    int res = 0, l = 0, r = n - 1; 
    int rMax = height[r], lMax = height[l]; 
    
    while (l < r) { 
        if (lMax < rMax) { 
            l++; 
            lMax = Math.max(lMax, height[l]); 
            res += lMax - height[l]; 
        } else { 
            r--; 
            rMax = Math.max(rMax, height[r]); 
            res += rMax - height[r]; 
        } 
    }
    return res; 
}
```
**Approach**:
- This solution uses a **two-pointer** technique to traverse the array from both ends.
- **lMax** and **rMax** track the maximum heights encountered from the left and right sides, respectively.
- For each position, the trapped water is calculated as the difference between the current maximum height and the height at that position.
- The time complexity is `O(n)` because each index is visited once.

### Solution 2: **Auxiliary arrays (left and right max height arrays)**
```java
public static int trappingRainWater(int arr[]) {
    int lft [] = new int[arr.length];
    lft[0] = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        lft[i] = Math.max(lft[i-1], arr[i]);
    }
    
    int rht[] = new int[arr.length];
    rht[arr.length - 1] = arr[arr.length - 1];
    for (int i = arr.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        rht[i] = Math.max(rht[i + 1], arr[i]);
    }
    
    int trappedWater = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int waterLevel = Math.min(lft[i], rht[i]);
        trappedWater += (waterLevel - arr[i]);
    }
    return trappedWater;
}
```
**Approach**:
- This solution uses **two auxiliary arrays**, `lft` and `rht`, to store the maximum height encountered from the left and right sides, respectively.
- The trapped water at each position is calculated by taking the minimum of the values in `lft` and `rht` arrays and subtracting the current height.
- The time complexity is `O(n)` for both the array processing and water calculation.

### Are they the same?
- **Result**: Both approaches solve the same problem and give the same result, but they use different techniques.
- **Efficiency**:
  - The first approach uses **constant space**, `O(1)` extra space (ignoring input array), because it only stores a few variables.
  - The second approach uses **extra space** `O(n)` because of the two additional arrays `lft` and `rht` to store the maximum heights.

### Conclusion:
- **Both solutions are logically equivalent** and will give the same result.
- The first approach is more space-efficient (`O(1)` extra space), whereas the second approach uses `O(n)` extra space due to the auxiliary arrays.
