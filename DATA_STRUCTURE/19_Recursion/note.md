// ! Recursion is a method of solving computational porblem where the solution depends on oslutions to smaller instances of the same problem .

- Base case , end of the recursion
  -- Top to down ( towards base case )
  -- bottom to top ( by combining the result)

## Steps

- 1 Base case
- Work
- f (n-1) inner call
