# 2D Arrays Questions

## Question 1  
Print the number of 7’s that are in the 2D array.

**Example:**  
Input:  
`int[][] array = { {4,7,8},{8,8,7} };`  
Output:  
`2`

---

## Question 2  
Print out the sum of the numbers in the second row of the “nums” array.

**Example:**  
Input:  
`int[][] nums = { {1,4,9},{11,4,3},{2,2,3} };`  
Output:  
`18`

---

## Question 3  
Write a program to find the transpose of a matrix.

### What is Transpose?
Transpose of a matrix is the process of swapping the rows to columns. For a 2x3 matrix:

**Matrix:**  
```
a11    a12    a13  
a21    a22    a23  
```

**Transposed Matrix:**  
```
a11    a21  
a12    a22  
a13    a23  
```
